## 📂 Task List

### ✅ Task 1: GUI Calculator (Native Windows API)
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `/Task 1`

A fully functional Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator built entirely in **C++ using the native Win32 API**. Unlike standard solutions that rely on heavy external frameworks, this application interacts directly with the Windows OS.

**Key Features:**
* **Native Performance:** Built with pure C++ and `windows.h` for zero dependency overhead.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Manages the Windows Message Loop manually.
* **Modern UI:** Implements `Segoe UI` fonts via `WM_SETFONT`.
* **Input Handling:** Supports both mouse clicks and keyboard input (Numpad support).

### ✅ Task 2: To-Do List Application (Console)
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `/Task 2`

A robust console-based task management system designed to demonstrate proficiency in **C++ Data Structures** and **Memory Management**. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently through a text-based interface.

**Key Features:**
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Storage:** Uses `std::vector` and `struct` to manage a dynamic list of tasks that grows and shrinks at runtime[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**CRUD Operations:** Users can **Create** (Add), **Read** (View), **Update** (Mark Complete), and **Delete** (Remove) tasks[cite: 46, 47].
* [cite_start]**Input Validation:** robust error handling to prevent crashes when users enter invalid numbers or text[cite: 54].
* **Clean UI:** Implements specific buffer clearing functions (`cin.ignore`) to ensure a smooth user experience without "skipping" inputs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** C++ (C++20 Standard)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2026
* **Frameworks:** Win32 API (Task 1), C++ Standard Library (Task 2)
* **Concepts:** Event Handling, Data Structures (Vectors), GUI Programming, Input Validation
